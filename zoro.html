<p>
  Zoro is the second member of the Straw Hat Pirates and the first to join, doing so after he is rescued by Monkey D. Luffy from execution. He is a highly skilled swordsman and serves as the crew's combatant.[a] He possesses an extremely poor sense of direction, which is a running gag throughout the series.
